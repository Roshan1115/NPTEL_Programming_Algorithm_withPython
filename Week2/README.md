1. A positive integer m can be partitioned as primes if it can be written as p + q where p > 0, q > 0 and both p and q are prime numbers.

Write a Python function primepartition(m) that takes an integer m as input and returns True if m can be partitioned as primes and False otherwise. (If m is not positive, your function should return False.)

Here are some examples of how your function should work.

>>> primepartition(7)
True

>>> primepartition(185)
False

>>> primepartition(3432)
True

2. Write a function matched(s) that takes as input a string s and checks if the brackets "(" and ")" in s are matched: that is, every "(" has a matching ")" after it and every ")" has a matching "(" before it. Your function should ignore all other symbols that appear in s. Your function should return True if s has matched brackets and False if it does not.

Here are some examples to show how your function should work.

>>> matched("zb%78")
True

>>> matched("(7)(a")
False

>>> matched("a)*(?")
False

>>> matched("((jkl)78(A)&l(8(dd(FJI:),):)?)")
True

3. A list rotation consists of taking the first element and moving it to the end. For instance, if we rotate the list [1,2,3,4,5], we get [2,3,4,5,1]. If we rotate it again, we get [3,4,5,1,2].

Write a Python function rotatelist(l,k) that takes a list l and a positive integer k and returns the list l after k rotations. If k is not positive, your function should return l unchanged. Note that your function should not change l itself, and should return the rotated list.

Here are some examples to show how your function should work.

>>> rotatelist([1,2,3,4,5],1)
[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]

>>> rotatelist([1,2,3,4,5],3)
[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

>>> rotatelist([1,2,3,4,5],12)
[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
